    \section{Available Data}

    \subsection{Linked Open Data}
    When \citet{berners2001semantic} introduced the idea of the semantic web as an evolution of the original document web, their vision was to allow agents to infer the meaning of instances and their relationships published in datasets on the web.
    This is enabled by assigning instances and relations to URIs from standardized vocabularies, making their meaning no more limited to the dataset's scope but globally valid.
    The semantic web relies on various technological standards of which some were specifically developed for it and others already existed.
    Firstly, just like the document web, it relies on HTTP for data transmission.
    RDF~\citep{RDF}, a standard published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the recommended language for transferring linked data and describes datasets as collections of triples consisting of subjects, predicates, and objects.
    Vocabularies for linked data are organized in ontologies, defined in the standards RDFS~\citep{RDFS} and OWL~\citep{OWL}.
    Finally, SPARQL~\citep{SPARQL}, another standard by the W3C is a query language that can be used to query linked datasets.

    \subsection{Linked Open Data Cloud}
    Probably the most prominent service around linked open data is the Linked Open Data Cloud (LOD cloud)
    \footnotemark{} (see Figure~\ref{fig:lod_cloud}).
    The LOD cloud is a diagram visualizing linked open datasets and their interconnections.

    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/lod-cloud-sm}
        \caption{The LOD Cloud\protect\footnotemark[\value{footnote}]}
        \label{fig:lod_cloud}
    \end{figure}

    For a dataset to be included, it has to meet certain requirements.
    For example, instances have to be annotated with URIs that resolve to RDF data, the dataset must contain at least 1000 triples, and it has to be connected via RDF links to datasets in the diagram with at least 50 links.
    The LOD cloud also provides metadata about the datasets.
    For example, it divides the datasets into different domains, like Media, Government, Publications, Social Networking, or Life Sciences.
    As of May 2021 this catalogue contained 1301 datasets and has become the subject of multiple investigations~\citep{debattista2019lod, kamdar2019enabling, schmachtenberg2014adoption}.

    \subsection{Life Sciences Linked Open Data Cloud}
    In this thesis, I will focus on datasets from the life sciences domain, colored red in Figure~\ref{fig:lod_cloud}.
    This part of the LOD Cloud is often also referred to as life-sciences LOD cloud (LSLOD Cloud) and is depicted in more detail in Figure~\ref{fig:lslod_cloud}.

    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/life-sciences-lod}
        \caption{The LSLOD Cloud\protect\footnotemark[\value{footnote}]}
        \label{fig:lslod_cloud}
    \end{figure}
    \footnotetext{The Linked Open Data Cloud, https://lod-cloud.net/, (Accessed on 01/06/2022)}

    Biomedical researchers have already been adopting semantic web technologies in their early stages~\citep{ashburner2000gene, bodenreider2004unified, wang2005xml}, motivated by a problem that still exists in the domain and was addressed by Vijay Bulusu, head of data and digital innovation at company Pfizer:
    \begin{nbquote}
        Vijay Bulusu opened his plenary session at the Bio-IT World Conference \& Expo last week by asking the audience whether - if given \$1 million to spend - they'd buy a machine learning platform or improve the quality of their data.
        Nearly everyone voted for improving data quality.
        Bulusu was pleased.
        Life sciences doesn't really have a big data problem, he explained.
        It has a "lots-of-small-data problem," and data should be our focus~\citep{Pfizer}.
    \end{nbquote}

    Datasets in the LSLOD cloud describe entities such as molecules (e.g., drugs or proteins) and their characteristics, biological pathways, organs, or diseases~\citep{bodenreider2008biomedical}.
    In their attempt to implement a query engine that was supposed to make SPARQL endpoints of LSLOD datasets more accessible, \citet{kamdar2014roadmap} catalogued linked concepts and properties from 137 public SPARQL endpoints to map concepts and properties to so-called Query Elements.
    Figure~\ref{fig:lslod_entities} gives an overview of the number of entities from the datasets linked to different types of Query Elements.

    \section{Data Publishers}
    A very large part of the datasets in the LSLOD Cloud are published two projects:
    NCBO BioPortal~\citep{BioPortal} and Bio2RDF~\citep{Bio2RDF}.

    \subsection{BioPortal}
    BioPortal is a project funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and provides centralized access to a collection of biomedical ontologies.
    Since the provided datasets are ontologies, they do not contain any instance data, but define classes and properties that can be used as vocabularies to type instances in other datasets.
    In January 2022, the collection consisted of 953 ontologies, containing $13,732,155$ classes, and $36,286$ properties\footnote{NCBO BioPortal, \url{https://bioportal.bioontology.org/}, (Accessed on 01/08/2022)}.
    Only a subset of these ontologies are registered in the LSLOD cloud.
    BioPortal is not the original publisher of the provided ontologies, but rather provide unified access to ontologies from different sources like SNOMED CT\footnote{SNOMED International, \url{https://www.snomed.org/}, (Accessed on 01/08/2022)}, a large, general purpose clinical ontology or RxNORM\footnote{RxNorm, \url{https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html}, (Accessed on 01/08/2022)}, an ontology about clinical drugs which is part of the UMLS, another project related to the NIH that also provides linked data, however not using semantic web technologies.

    \subsection{Bio2RDF}
    Bio2RDF is an open source project maintained by Maastricht University and Universit\'e Laval and claims to provide the largest network of linked data in the domain of life sciences\citep{Bio2RDF_Github}.
    Like BioPortal, Bio2RDF are not the authors of the datasets they publish, but rather translated datasets from sources such as DrugBank\footnote{DrugBank Online, \url{https://go.drugbank.com/}, (Accessed on 01/08/2022)} or FarmGKB\footnote{PharmGKB, \url{https://www.pharmgkb.org/}, (Accessed on 01/08/2022)} into RDF\@.
    In contrast to BioPortal however, Bio2RDF provides LSLOD datasets with instance data and not ontologies.



    Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
    not indented.
    The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
    equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

    Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

    \subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
    headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
    they are formatted as run-in headings.

    \paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
    The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
    headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

    \begin{table}
        \caption{Table captions should be placed above the
        tables.}\label{tab1}
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            Heading level     & Example                                          & Font size and style \\
            \hline
            Title (centered)  & {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes}                  & 14 point, bold      \\
            1st-level heading & {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction}                 & 12 point, bold      \\
            2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area}                    & 10 point, bold      \\
            3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold      \\
            4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows    & 10 point, italic    \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}

    Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
    schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see

    \begin{theorem}
        This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
        the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
        propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.

%
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

    \begin{proof}
        Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
        while the following text appears in normal font.
    \end{proof}
    For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
    and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
    convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
